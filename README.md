# Nuzzle
Nuzzle is a lightweight, fast packet sniffer that looks for unexpected network scans and potential attacks. It is intended for use by people who run online servers. (Regular home users probably won't have a use for it.)

Use Nuzzle to:
* Monitor: Learn about the scans and attacks your server typically receives.
* Detect: As part of an intrusion detection system (IDS), Nuzzle rapidly provides insight into the types of scans and attacks your system receives.
* Prevent: With Fail2Ban, implement a simple but extremely effective intrusion prevention system (IPS).Lightweight, fast network attack detection IDS and IPS

For more details and examples, including how to compile, install, run, and deploy as an IDS or IPS, see: https://nuzzle.hackerfactor.com/
